# journal_keyword_extraction
<p>An exploratory attempt to start crawling through academic journal issues and extract keywords from them</p>
<p>Mostly inspired from Ryan Mitchell's book "Web Scraping with Python" available at O'Reilly: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034391.do</p>
<p>Get this book, it's really awesome!</p>
